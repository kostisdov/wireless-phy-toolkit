# Wireless PHY Toolkit

Clean implementations of wireless PHY algorithms, with tests and documentation.

## 👋 About

I'm Kostis Dovelos, a Senior Wireless Communications Engineer who enjoys bridging theory and real-world communication systems.

**Why this project exists:**

After years of prototyping in MATLAB, I’m moving deeper into software engineering and building well-structured implementations of classical and new PHY algorithms. This repo documents that journey.


**My approach:**
- Start with Python for clarity
- Add C/C++ extensions for performance and bit-accurate implementations
- Include short theory notes and references when needed
- Write proper tests 
- Share what I learn

If this helps other engineers understand these algorithms better, or saves someone from reimplementing things poorly, that's a win.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal project, but contributions are welcome! If you:
- Find a bug or have a suggestion → Open an issue
- Want to add an algorithm → Let's discuss first (open an issue)
- Spot an error in implementation → Pull requests appreciated

**Code standards:**
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Type hints required
- Document with references to original papers
- Black formatting, pylint clean
